# Welcome to My First Post

This is my first blog post written in Markdown. In this post, I'll introduce you to Next.js, a powerful framework that makes it easy to build and deploy React applications. Whether you're building a static website, a single-page application, or a server-rendered app, Next.js has you covered.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides out-of-the-box features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes. It simplifies the process of creating optimized web applications by handling much of the configuration for you.

### Key Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Automatically render pages on the server, improving performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pre-render pages at build time, offering fast load times.
- **API Routes:** Build backend APIs directly within your Next.js application.
- **Automatic Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller bundles for faster page loading.
- **Image Optimization:** Next.js provides built-in support for optimizing images, reducing load times.

## Why Use Next.js?

## Getting Started

To get started with Next.js, you can create a new project by running the following command in your terminal:
