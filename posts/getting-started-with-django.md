# Django: The Framework for Perfectionists with Deadlines

Django is a high-level Python web framework that allows developers to build robust web applications quickly. It comes with a lot of built-in features, which saves developers from the hassle of repetitive tasks.

## What is Django?

Django follows the “Don’t Repeat Yourself” (DRY) principle and promotes the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It is designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.

### Key Features

- **Built-In Admin Interface:** Django provides a powerful admin interface to manage your app's data.
- **ORM:** Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) simplifies database interactions.
- **Security:** Django has built-in protection against many common security threats.

Django is a comprehensive framework that provides almost everything you need to build a web application, from templates and routing to forms and authentication. It’s ideal for developers who need to build web apps quickly without compromising on security or scalability.

## Getting Started

To get started with Django, you can create a new Django project by running the following command:

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
```

## Main Components
- **Models:** Define the data structure.
- **Views:** Handle the request/response logic.
- **Templates:** Define the presentation layer.
- **Forms:** Handle user input and validation.

## Example Code
```python
from django.db import models

class Blog(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    published_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
