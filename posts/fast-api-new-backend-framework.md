# FastAPI: Build Fast, High-Performance APIs

FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python, known for its speed and ease of use. It leverages Python's type hints to provide quick development with high performance.

## What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a high-performance web framework designed for building APIs quickly and efficiently. It is built on standard Python type hints, enabling easy and automatic validation, serialization, and documentation.

### Key Features

- **High Performance:** FastAPI is one of the fastest web frameworks available, comparable to Node.js and Go.
- **Automatic Documentation:** FastAPI generates interactive API documentation automatically.
- **Asynchronous Capabilities:** FastAPI is fully compatible with asynchronous programming, allowing you to build high-performance applications.

## Why Use FastAPI?

FastAPIâ€™s combination of speed, simplicity, and modern features makes it an excellent choice for building robust APIs. Its automatic generation of documentation and support for asynchronous programming set it apart from other frameworks.

## Getting Started

To get started with FastAPI, you can create a new FastAPI project by running the following command:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

## Popular Use Cases
- **Microservices:** Due to its speed and efficiency, FastAPI is great for building microservices.
- **APIs:** FastAPI excels in creating RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently.
- **Machine Learning:** FastAPI is often used to deploy machine learning models as REST APIs.

## Example Code
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
